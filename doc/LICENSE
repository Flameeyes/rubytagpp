This text is not a forma license, but rather an explanation of the licenses
involved in RubyTag++.

The RubyTag++ package consists of two main parts, the first is the C++ bindings
generator. It's a new work, unrelated to TagLib and to anything else. That work
is covered by GNU General Public License, version 2 or (at your option) any
later version of that license, with the exclusion of the C++ glue code used to
create the actual bindings, that's released under Public Domain.

The actual RubyTag++ bindings, generated by the above set of scripts, are
released under GNU Lesser General Public License, version 2.1 or (at your
option) any later version of that license, the same used for TagLib itself.

For any functional use of the RubyTag++ bindings, the GNU Lesser General Public
License rules. If you intend instead use or extend the C++ bindings generator,
you must abide GNU General Public License.
